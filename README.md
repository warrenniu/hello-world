Hello everyone!

My name is Warren & I'm an aspiring software engineer. My goal is to learn & hone my skills in coding to apply to an immersive software engineer bootcamp.

I am currently unemployed and have a background in Healthcare & Partnerships management. My interests include soccer, staying active, traveling, and reading!
